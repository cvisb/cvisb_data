  <h3>Curated alignments</h3>
  <p>
    Our viral sequencing datasets combine genomic sequences generated as part of our consortium with publicly available sequences. In addition to providing the raw data, we also curate sequences of high quality and provide the alignments to the
    broader community for downstream analyses.

    <h5>Alignment methodology</h5>
    <p>
      Sequences with lower quality (manual curation) and incomplete sequences (<95% of (GP+NP) or (Z+L) ORFs length, 289 removed) are excluded from the curated alignment. Remaining sequences are trimmed to their coding regions, codon aligned using
        mafft and inspected manually. ORFs are arranged in sense orientation as follows: S segment: NP -NNNNNN- GP L segment: L -NNNNNN- Z A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny is reconstructed with RAxML using the general time-reversible (GTR)
        nucleotide substitution model, gamma-distributed rates among sites and bootstrap resampling with 500 replicates. </p> </section> </div>
