      What are the immunological, genetic, microbial and physiological attributes that play essential roles in determining outcomes from viral infections? The mission of the Center for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB; pronounced “SEE-VIZ-bee”) is to identify such
      factors and elucidate the molecular and immunological networks that determine outcomes of human disease. We hope that via this research we will be able to provide a deep system-level understanding of the virus and human determinants of clinical
      outcome to discover predictive markers of disease, and guide future therapies.

      We will achieve these goals by applying several ‘omics’ technologies, continuous physiological sensing, and high-throughput experimental approaches to unique patient and survivor cohorts of Lassa fever and Ebola virus disease in West Africa. We will develop
      predictive models for identifying critical disease correlates and analyze large-scale data sets to pinpoint causal host-pathogen interactions. By elucidation the molecular networks that play critical roles in clinical outcomes, this research will
      allow us to identify new targets for medicines and vaccines, inform personalized treatment strategies, and provide novel computational algorithms applicable to a wide range of other human pathogens.

      Please note that this data is still based on work in progress and should be considered preliminary. If you intend to include any of these data in publications, please let us know – otherwise please feel free to download and use without restrictions. We
      have shared this data with the hope that people will download and use it, as well as scrutinize it so we can improve our methods and analyses. Please contact us if you have any questions or comments – we’ll buy beers for #ResearchParasites that
      spot flaws and faults in the data and come up with improvements!
