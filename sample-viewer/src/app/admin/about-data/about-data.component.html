  <!-- <h4>How the data are compiled</h4> -->

  <h4><a routerLink="/schema">Schema</a></h4>
  <p>
    Building off of <a href="http://www.schema.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">schema.org</a>'s data models, we created schema to organize and standardize our patient, sample, dataset, experiment, and other related data.
  </p>

  <h4>Data dictionaries</h4>
  <p>
    ... will be coming soon. In the meantime, peruse our <a routerLink="/schema">schema</a>, which contain information about how we define variables in our datasets.
  </p>

  <h4>Limitations</h4>

    Please note that this data is still based on work in progress and should be considered preliminary. If you intend to include any of these data in publications, please let us know – otherwise please feel free to download and use without restrictions. We
    have shared this data with the hope that people will download and use it, as well as scrutinize it so we can improve our methods and analyses. Please contact us if you have any questions or comments – we’ll buy beers for #ResearchParasites that spot
    flaws and faults in the data and come up with improvements!
