Natural Earth 10 m cultural world map downloaded on 9 October 2019: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/
1:110m version was a bit too rough on West Africa; SLE looked like a shapeless blob.
Therefore:
1. Running through mapshaper to reduce file size: 2.5%
2. Exported as geojson
3. Removing everything not in Western Africa
